    Adds initial state estimation to your optimization problem *using goal programming*.

    Before any other goals are evaluated, first, the deviation between initial
    state measurements and their respective model states is minimized in the
    least squares sense (1DVAR, priority -2). Secondly, the distance between
    pairs of states is minimized, again in the least squares sense, so that
    "smooth" initial guesses are provided for states without measurements
    (priority -1).

    .. note::

        There are types of problems where, in addition to minimizing
        differences between states and measurements, it is advisable to
        perform a steady-state initialization using additional initial-time
        model equations.  For hydraulic models, for instance, it is often
        helpful to require that the time-derivative of the flow variables
        vanishes at the initial time.
